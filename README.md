# OMDB Movie Search

This mobile app was built in a day with react-native, redux, redux-sagas, and expo! I use the very awesome OMDB API to query for movies: [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

I plan on writing a blog post soon on what I learned building mobile apps without android studio or xcode. In the meantime, there is a live demo for v1 of the app on my personal site under the ReactJS tab [here](https://brobertsups.github.io).
